# The following scripts should be run in R
#Average PSI and heatmap for brain DSG.R: plot the Average PSI and heatmap for differential spiced genes between ecotypes in brain

#Average PSI and heatmap for liver DSG.R: plot the Average PSI and heatmap for differential spiced genes between ecotypes in liver

#pca and heatmap for deg.R: plot the pca for brain differential expressed genes between ecotypes

#pca and heatmap for miRNA.R: plot the pca for brain differential expressed miRNAs between ecotypes

#pca for exon-base.R/pca for intron-base.R: plot the exon-based and intron-based splicing patterns for marine and freshwater ecotypes in brain and liver

#pca for rmats_all event.R: plot the pca of alternative splicing events for marine and freshwater ecotypes in brain and liver 

#methylation.R: DNA methylation analysis

#effectsize.R: estimate the effect size (partial eta, Î·2) of ecotype effect (i.e., marine and freshwater) on DEG/DSG/DEmiR/DMC in brain and liver
